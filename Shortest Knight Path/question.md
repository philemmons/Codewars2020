### Shortest Knight Path

<p> Given two different positions on a chess board, find the least number of moves it would take a knight to get from one to the other. The positions will be passed as two arguments in algebraic notation. For example, knight("a3", "b5") should return 1.

<p> The knight is not allowed to move off the board. The board is 8x8.
