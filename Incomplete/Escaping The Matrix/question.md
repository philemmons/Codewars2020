### Escaping The Matrix

<p> Help Neo to escape the matrix by throwing himself out!

<p> Neo is an exception, which is defined already:
<pre>
public final class Neo extends Exception {}
</pre>
<p> The example test is the same one as the real test case, so if your code pass the example test case, you are good to go!

<p> Hint: although Neo is an exception, there is nothing special about it, the solution is pretty generic.
