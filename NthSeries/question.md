### Task:

<p> Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

<p> Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...

Rules:
<br>
- You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.
- If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00
- You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

<p> Examples:

- SeriesSum(1) => 1 = "1.00"
- SeriesSum(2) => 1 + 1/4 = "1.25"
- SeriesSum(5) => 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 = "1.57"

<br>
NOTE: In PHP the function is called series_sum().
