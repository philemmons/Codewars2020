### Dashatize It

<p> Given a variable n,

<p> If n is an integer, Return a string with dash'-'marks before and after each odd integer, but do not begin or end the string with a dash mark. If n is negative, then the negative sign should be removed.

<p> If n is not an integer, return an empty value.

<p> Ex:

> dashatize(274) -> '2-7-4'

> dashatize(6815) -> '68-1-5'
